        - Brief Synopsis of Research - My project focuses on discovery and development of a specific anti-cancer compound for the treatment of BCR-ABL positive leukemia. A novel drug discovery demands a rigorous screening design and utilization of diverse approaches for target identification. During my PhD I have established a co-culture based high-throughput drug screening where we identified a novel anti-cancer compound that is more potent than the current standard of care and in the process of further development.
